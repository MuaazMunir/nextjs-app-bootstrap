# ðŸŽ¬ ProEdit Studio - Google Play Store Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you create an Android App Bundle (AAB) file ready for upload to Google Play Console. AAB is the preferred format for Google Play Store distribution.

## Quick Start

### For Windows Users:
```bash
# Double-click or run in Command Prompt:
build-aab.bat
```

### For Linux/Mac Users:
```bash
# Make executable and run:
chmod +x build-aab.sh
./build-aab.sh
```

## Prerequisites

### Required Software:
1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Android Studio** - [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio)
3. **Java JDK 11+** - [Download](https://adoptium.net/)
4. **Google Play Console Account** - [Sign up](https://play.google.com/console)

### Environment Setup:
```bash
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# For Windows (Command Prompt):
set ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
```

## Step-by-Step AAB Build Process

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Capacitor CLI globally
npm install -g @capacitor/cli

# Install required Capacitor plugins
npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/core @capacitor/app @capacitor/haptics @capacitor/keyboard @capacitor/status-bar
```

### 2. Build the Application
```bash
# Build Next.js application
npm run build
npm run export

# Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# Sync files
npx cap sync android
```

### 3. Create Signing Keystore (First Time Only)
```bash
# Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/app/proedit-studio.keystore \
  -alias proedit-studio \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (remember this!)
# - Key password (can be same as keystore)
# - Your name and organization details
```

### 4. Configure Signing
Edit `android/gradle.properties` and add:
```properties
PROEDIT_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=proedit-studio.keystore
PROEDIT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=proedit-studio
PROEDIT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
PROEDIT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

### 5. Build Android App Bundle
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

### 6. Locate Your AAB File
The AAB file will be created at:
- **Path**: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
